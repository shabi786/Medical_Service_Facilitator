# Medical Service Facilitator [WIP]

## Abstract

A patient will use our web app to book an appointment with a doctor based on their symptoms. The application will predict the disease based on symptoms, and automatically find and book an
appointment to the most suitable doctor. The doctor will use the app to find all the past appointments and treatments that the patient has gone through and this will help in making decisions easier.

## Tools/ Technology Used

1. Angular for Front End of Web Application.
2. MongoDB as database
3. Flask for Backend of the application
4. Machine Learning for prediction of disease

## Module Description

The patient will first use our web app to enter their details. The web app will then send the data to server where predictions and analysis of disease will take place. The server will send the data and the suitable doctor for the treatment. The patient will book an appointment on the web app and will be
given a unique ID. The doctor will perform the necessary check-ups and will update the details of each appointment using the web app. The doctor can also see the past appointment data. The user can also update their details using the web app (like blood glucose if the patient is diabetic and has a glucometer at
home), thus the doctor will get a more effective history of patient.
